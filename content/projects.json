            "p1" : "Of the Sky is a third person 3D exploration and puzzle solving game. It takes place in a floating island world inspired by the beautiful scenery found on the Swedish island of Gotland. Using the easy to understand mechanics, explore the many floating islands, solve puzzles, and try to uncover the mystery of the fire keeping the islands afloat in the sky! You play as Hymn, a mysterious spirit-like creature whose motives are unknown, but who you can’t help but want to help guide.",
            "p2" : "In the development of the game my responsibilities included gameplay programming, system building, UI programming, aduio programming, shader programming, performance optimization and more. I also spent a lot of time working with the lighting and VFX.",
            "p3" : "Most of my time went into the gameplay programming and the game feel. I decided to code all of the animations in the game rather than having the artists animating their models, as it gave us much more flexibility. With the system I built, non-programmer members of the team could themselves go in and change the properties of the animations dynamically during gameplay to see what would fit the best. This saved us a lot of time on redoing animations and such.",

This prevents unnatural structures and floating pieces being left after the giant has partially destroyed the building.",
